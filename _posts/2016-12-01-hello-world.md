### Bash and Terminal basics
Using the terminal can be pretty intimidating for someone new to coding. But it's actually very simple and predictable once you understand what it does.

If you think about your computer as some kinda of video game-- maybe some kind of fancy JRPG with fancy buttons and menu screens, then the terminal is the text-adventure version of your computer! It can do almost everything you normally do (more or less), but you specify mystical commands into an abysmal black screen in the form of short esoteric words-- that have no mnemonic device toward how it functions. But don't worry! It's as simple as swish and flick~

Here are some examples of what you can do with the Terminal!

- `ls`: listing the files of a directory

- `cd`: changing to different directory

- `mkdir`: making a new directory

- `touch`: creating a blank file

- `cat`: printing the contents of a file
